                                When you are doing business or dealing with brokers or legal representatives, there is a lot of transaction fees that you must pay for every transaction. On top of it, there is a lot of paperwork, brokerage fee, commission and other things to be met.
                                When you use cryptocurrency, it removes the need of the middle man. The transaction would take place one to one on the secure network. The transactions would be transparent, and it becomes easier for you to establish the
                                audit trails.

                                The cryptocurrencies can be used to transfer the ownership of assets on one name to another name by paying the seller through bitcoin. It all happens in the blockchain ecosystem. It facilitates you to carry out the transactions safely and securely. The
                                cryptocurrencies would be designed to add third-party approvals and can be completed on the future date. If you are the person who holds the cryptocurrency and has authority on the account, you can reduce the time and expenses
                                involved in the transaction of assets.

                                When you use cash or credit, the transaction history would be recorded, and this record will be available for the banks. Whenever you do the transaction, the bank records it. However, you can check the balance that is in the account whenever you want.
                                When you are carrying out complicated business transactions, there would be a lot of financial history checks. The best part of using cryptocurrency is that every transaction you carry out with the recipient would be unique.
                                You can get into terms negotiation every deal.
